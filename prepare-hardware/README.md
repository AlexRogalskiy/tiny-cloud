# Prepare hardware

## Raspberry Pi

Flash a prepared Raspbian with Docker and cloud-init and adjust the `user-data` file
before first boot. After turning on the Raspberry Pi your node is up and running.

## UP Board

Prepare a bootable USB stick with Ubuntu and the preseed files. Adjust the
preseed files to set hostname and SSH keys. After turning on the UP board it
will take about half an hour to have the internal eMMC card installed with
Ubuntu and Docker.
