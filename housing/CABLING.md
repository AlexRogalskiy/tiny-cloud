# Part 5 - Cabling

In [part 4](./SWITCHES.md) we used velcro tape to fix the switches. Now it's time to add the cabling. But you will see very soon that we have to do it in the right order to make it easier to disassemble the whole thing again. I learned this the hard way before my way to DockerCon 2017 as I thought how I should reassemble the PiCloud again in the Hotel in Austin.

## Power cables

First remove all Ankers and switches again.

Insert the two power cables for the Ankers and then the four power cables for the UP boards through the left whole in the back.

Arrange the cables to fit to their desired places.

Now use cable ties to fix the cabling. Use an eight port plug strip with a power switch so you can turn on the cloud with just one switch. I also needed only one US adapter to power that at DockerCon 2017 in Austin.

## Network cables for first switch

It helped me a lot to tie the network cables together.

Insert the switch with the network cables and arrange the network cables like this.
