# Part 3 - Assemble Anker USB Power supplies

In [part 3](./RISERCARDS.md) you have assembled the riser cards. Now before we put them into the housing we attach the Anker USB Power supplies and make them stick.

We have used velcro tape to fix the Ankers in the housing. So we can easily disassemble everything again.
