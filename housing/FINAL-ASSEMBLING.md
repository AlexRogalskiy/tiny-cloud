# Part 6 - Final assembling

In [part 5](./CABLING.md) we inserted all the cables into the housing. Now it's time to insert the riser cards and connect power and network cables to each node.

## First row

Start with the first row (the front side with the edge router). Insert the Raspberry Pis and connect the patch cable and USB cable, one riser card after another.
